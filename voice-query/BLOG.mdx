VoiceQuery is a cross-platform mobile application engineered to provide seamless voice-based document analysis and retrieval. Users upload documents, then interact with them using voice commands and natural language queries. The system transcribes speech, processes queries against document context, and delivers synthesized responses—all within a single integrated workflow.

VoiceQuery was build as an exploratory project to understant practical AI applications and to experiment with agentic AI patterns.

VoiceQuery is a cross-platform mobile application engineered to provide seamless voice-based document analysis and retrieval. Users upload documents, then interact with them using voice commands and natural language queries. The system transcribes speech, processes queries against document context, and delivers synthesized responses—all within a single integrated workflow.

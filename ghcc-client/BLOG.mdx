<TechBadge icon="GhCC Client" packageUrl="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ghcc-client"/> was built to solve a very real developer friction point — **powerful CLI tools are still tied to the desktop**.

While <TechBadge icon="Copilot"/> CLI is incredibly capable, interacting with it away from your machine is difficult. Typing complex commands on a mobile keyboard is frustrating, and many interactive terminal controls simply don’t translate well to touch devices. GhCC Client bridges this gap by transforming your Copilot CLI session into a mobile-accessible, voice-friendly experience.

The idea was straightforward but impactful: keep your Copilot CLI running in a persistent terminal session and remotely interact with it from any device with a browser. This enables lightweight development workflows even when you're not sitting at your desk.

Under the hood, the tool uses <TechBadge icon="Node"/> to power the CLI client and orchestrate the workflow. <TechBadge icon="Tmux" repoUrl="https://github.com/tmux/tmux" /> ensures sessions remain alive across disconnects and terminal closures, while <TechBadge icon="ttyd" repoUrl="https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd" /> a web-based terminal layer exposes the session securely to mobile devices via <TechBadge icon="SocketIO"/>. A custom mobile keyboard toolbar recreates essential desktop keys like Ctrl, Tab, and arrow keys — controls that are normally missing on phones.

One of the most practical aspects of GhCC Client is its **voice-friendly workflow**. By leveraging native mobile speech-to-text (like Gboard’s microphone), users can speak prompts naturally and send them directly to Copilot CLI, turning the terminal into a more conversational interface.

The end result is a lightweight remote interaction layer purpose-built for AI CLIs — not a heavy remote desktop replacement, but a focused bridge that makes Copilot more portable and accessible.

## Things to consider

- The project was built in **3 days** for the GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge and is an MVP.  
- Compatibility across all environments is still evolving and may require further testing.
- The tool intentionally focuses on terminal interaction rather than full remote machine control.

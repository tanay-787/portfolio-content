When I built **CleatCentral** as my capstone project for the Full-Stack Development Bootcamp, I didn’t want it to be *just another e-commerce clone*. I wanted to craft something that felt modern, polished, and actually solved a niche problem — helping football players find the right boots.

## Why CleatCentral?

Buying football cleats online can be tricky. You don’t just pick a size and brand — you need to think about playing surface, boot height, and style. Most e-commerce sites don’t make this decision-making process easy. That’s where CleatCentral steps in: a **football-focused shopping platform** that not only sells cleats but also educates players about the right choice for their game.

## Standout Features

Beyond the standard shopping features, I added some UI touches to elevate the user experience:

- **Product Carousel** – On product detail pages, users can browse through multiple product views in a clean, interactive carousel.
    ![Cleat Example Product](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanay-787/portfolio-content/HEAD/cleat-central/assets/branding-dark.png) 
<p className="text-center text-sm text-muted-foreground -mt-2">Product detail page with carousel for different product views.</p>

- **Dynamic Theme-Aware Branding** – Both the **logo and favicon automatically adapt** to light or dark theme preferences. The system even detects OS theme settings for a personalized experience.

   <Carousel className="w-full max-w-sm mx-auto my-8">

          <p className="text-center text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">Dynamic theme-aware branding (Light Mode).</p>
        </CarouselItem>
        <CarouselItem>

          <p className="text-center text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">Dynamic theme-aware branding (Dark Mode).</p>
        </CarouselItem>
      </CarouselContent>
      <CarouselPrevious />
      <CarouselNext />
    </Carousel>

- **“Know Your Boots” Blog** – A one-of-a-kind guide that breaks down boot types (Firm Ground, Turf, Indoor, etc.) and styles (High-Top vs. Low-Top). This feature transforms CleatCentral from a store into a *trusted advisor*, helping users make informed purchases.

## Lessons Learned

- The importance of **balancing scope vs. polish** (I focused on a clean, working experience first because of the time-constraints and planned order history/payment features for later).
- Implementing **theme-aware assets** to make branding feel more “alive.”
- The whole process of developing and deploying a full-stack application on the cloud.

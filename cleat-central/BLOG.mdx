When I built **CleatCentral** as my capstone project for the Full-Stack Development Bootcamp, I didn’t want it to be *just another e-commerce clone*. In CleatCentral, I wanted to build something that felt modern, polished, and actually solved a niche problem — helping young football athletes find the right boots for them.

## The Separation

Buying football cleats online can be tricky. You don’t just pick a size and brand — you need to think about playing surface, boot height, and style. Most e-commerce sites don’t make this decision-making process easy. That’s where CleatCentral steps in: a **football-focused shopping platform** that not only sells cleats but also educates players about the right choice for their game.

## Key Features

Beyond the standard shopping features, I added some UI touches to elevate the user experience:

- **Product Carousel** – On product detail pages, users can browse through multiple product views in a clean, interactive carousel.

<p className="text-center text-sm text-muted-foreground -mt-2 mb-8">Product detail page with carousel for different product views.</p>

- **Dynamic Theme-Aware Branding** – Both the **logo and favicon automatically adapt** to light or dark theme preferences. The system even detects OS theme settings for a personalized experience.

- **“Know Your Boots” Blog** – A unique guide that breaks down boot types (Firm Ground, Turf, Indoor, etc.) and styles (High-Top vs. Low-Top).

Act4Fitness was built as part of upGrad’s Frontend Development Hackathon, where it emerged as the winning solution. The idea was simple—create a fitness tracking experience that feels intuitive, clean, and genuinely helpful for users who want to stay consistent with their goals.

The focus was on building a modern, easy-to-use interface that lets users track their progress step by step without feeling overwhelmed. React and Tailwind CSS were used to keep the UI fast and responsive, with shadcn/ui helping to create reusable, well-structured components. State management was handled using the React Context API, while the LocalStorage API was used to persist user data across sessions. Overall, Act4Fitness is designed with performance, accessibility, and a smooth user experience in mind.

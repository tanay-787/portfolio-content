Act4-Fitness was built as part of KnowledgeHut upGrad’s Frontend Development Hackathon, where it emerged as the winning solution.

The idea was simple — create a fitness tracking experience that feels clean and genuinely helpful for users who want to stay consistent with their goals. The focus was on building a modern, easy-to-use interface that lets users track their progress step by step without feeling overwhelmed.

A combination of <TechBadge icon="React"/>, <TechBadge icon="Tailwind"/>, and reusable <TechBadge icon="Shadcn-ui"/> components creates a fast and responsive UI. State management is handled using the React Context API, while the LocalStorage API is used to persist user data across sessions. <TechBadge icon="Vite"/> was chosen for bundling the web-app due to its fast build times, built-in Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and clean developer experience. Overall, Act4-Fitness is designed with accessibility and a smooth user experience in mind.

## Things to consider

- The entire application was developed in 2 days (a constraint of the hackathon).
- While the UI may seem easy to recreate using modern AI website builders, it’s important to note that this project was built at a time when such tools were not available, and shadcn/ui components were still relatively new.

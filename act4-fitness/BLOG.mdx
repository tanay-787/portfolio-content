Act4Fitness was built as part of upGrad’s Frontend Development Hackathon, where it emerged as the winning solution. The idea was simple- create a fitness tracking experience that feels intuitive, clean, and genuinely helpful for users who want to stay consistent with their goals.

The focus was on building a modern, easy-to-use interface that lets users track their progress step by step without feeling overwhelmed. React and Tailwind CSS were used to keep the UI fast and responsive, while shadcn/ui helped in creating reusable, well-structured components. Overall, Act4Fitness is designed with performance, accessibility and a smooth user experience in mind.
